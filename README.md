# SAE-RoR
Simulated Automotive Environment for the Rules Of the Road - (SAE-RoR)

## Goal:

> Design, formalise, implement and verify the Road Junction rules into an intelligent agent, which indeed represents the behaviour of an Autonomous Vehicle.

> We aim to obtain answers towards the adaption of the Road Junction rules into an Autonomous Vehicles.

## Brief description:

> SAE-RoR is an extension of Simulated Automotive Environment (SAE). SAE is the first version of a simulation environment for an intelligent agent written in Gwendolen agent programming language. Our agent models the behaviour of an Autonomous Vehicle. Moreover, we verify some formal properties related to the AV-agent by using Model Checking techniques (MCAPL).

> Now, SAE-RoR is designed to determine a formal representation for the Road Junction rules from the UK Highway Code. This formal representation is obtained using Linear Temporal Logic (LTL).

> Our ongoing work will present the following:

>> The Road Junction rules embedded into a Gwendolen agent.

>> Design of an Environment in Java, representing crossroads, intersections, traffic signals, road users, etc.

>> Formal verification of related properties using MCAPL and AJPF.


> SAE-RoR is part of a research project, which is a collaboration between Federal University of Technology - Parana (UTFPR) and University of Liverpool.

# SAE-RoR
Simulated Automotive Environment for the Rules Of the Road - (SAE-RoR)

## Current version:

> **AV-agent-00**: the agent and the environment work for the following Road Junction rules (from UK Highway Code):
>> rules **170**, **171**, **172**.

>> UK Highway Code:[https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-highway-code/using-the-road-159-to-203] 

## Goal:

> Design, formalise, implement and verify the Road Junction rules into an intelligent agent, which represents the behaviour of an Autonomous Vehicle.

> We aim to assess the adaption of the Road Junction rules into an Autonomous Vehicle.

## Brief description:

> **SAE-RoR** brings a complete architecture to assess the application of Road Junction rules, here are the main stages of our architecture:

>> 1. Formal representation of the Road Junction rules from the UK Highway Code using Linear Temporal Logic (LTL).
>> 2. Modelling Agent and Environment using timed automata with UPPAAL.
>> 3. Implementation of Agent and Environment using **Gwendolen** agent programming language.
>> 4. Formal verification of Road Junction properties using **UPPAAL**.
>> 5. Formal verification of Road Junction properties using **MCAPL/AJPF**.

> SAE-RoR is part of a research project, which is a collaboration between Federal University of Technology - Parana (UTFPR) and University of Manchester.

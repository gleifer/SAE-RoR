# SAE-RoR
Simulated Automotive Environment for the Rules of the Road - (SAE-RoR)

## Goal:

> Investigate the design, formalisation, implementation and verification of the Road Junction rules into an intelligent agent, which indeed represents the high-level decisions of an Autonomous Vehicle.

> We aim to obtain answers towards the adaption of the Road Junction rules into an Autonomous Vehicles.

## Brief description:

> SAE-RoR is an extension of Simulated Automotive Environment (SAE). SAE is the first version of a simulator for an intelligent agent written in Gwendolen agent programming language. Our agent models the behaviour of an Autonomous Vehicle. Yet we verify some formal properties related to our AV-agent via Model Checking.

> Now, SAE-RoR is designed to determine a formal representation of the Road Junction rules from the UK Highway Code. This formal representation is established using LTL.

> Besides, our ongoing work will present the following:

>> The Road Junction rules embedded into a Gwendolen agent.

>> Design of an Environment in Java, representing crossroads, intersections, traffic signals, road users, etc.

>> Formal verification of related properties using MCAPL and AJPF.


> SAE-RoR is part of a research project, which is a collaboration between Federal University of Technology - Parana (UTFPR) and University of Liverpool.
